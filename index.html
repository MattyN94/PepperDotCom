        <h1>A dog called Pepper.</h1>
        <img src="Pepper1.PNG" alt="Ain't she pretty.">
        <p>This is a simple website dedicated to my dog, best friend, and favourite thing in the entire world, <strong>Pepper.</strong>
        It's also a convenient way of showcasing the fact that I can kinda build websites using HTML and CSS (and maybe a bit of JS, who knows) and using her as a subject means I'm more likely to actually commit to the project and make it look good.</p>
        <h2>A short story about a dog.</h2>
        <p>Let's start by introducing you to Pepsi (I call her Pepsi more than I call her Pepper). She's two and a half years old, and she's a smooth coat Cockapoo. Yes, she doesn't look like one.
          <p>Her father is a working cocker and her mother is a Cockapoo so technically, Peps is 75% cocker spaniel and 25% poodle.
          </p>
          <p>Because of this, she does actually shed her fur even though most of us get poodle-cross breeds to stop this exact thing from happening.
          Pepsi's got the incredible nose of a pedigree working cocker, so she can smell a sandwich from a mile away and will sprint at full speed to go an eat it off the floor. As hinted at earlier, you'd be forgiven for thinking she's just a cocker spaniel, until you notice her snout is less boxy than a spaniels.

              <h4>(these may actually be just what she's forced to listen to at home, and this may also be just me showing I know how to make ordered lists)</h4>
